Tensors are fundamental data structures used in machine learning, particularly in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. 
They generalize vectors and matrices to higher dimensions, allowing for flexible and efficient data manipulation in numerical computations.

# Tensor is a generalization of: 
    ## Scalars: 0-dimensional tensors (single numbers).
    ## Vectors: 1-dimensional tensors (arrays of numbers).
    ## Matrices: 2-dimensional tensors (tables of numbers).
    ## Higher-dimensional arrays (3D, 4D, etc.).
