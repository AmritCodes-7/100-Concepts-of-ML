Model-based learning refers to a machine learning approach where the algorithm builds a generalizable model during the training phase by learning patterns, relationships, and structures in the data. 
This model is then used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.
Unlike instance-based learning, where the algorithm memorizes the training data and makes predictions based on similarity, model-based learning creates an abstract representation of the data (a model) that encapsulates the underlying patterns.

# Steps in Model-Based Learning:
    ## Choose a Model: Select a hypothesis or model family (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, etc.) that fits the problem.
    ## Learn Model Parameters: Optimize the model's parameters (e.g., coefficients, weights) to minimize the error on the training data.
    ## Evaluate the Model: Assess how well the model generalizes to new data using validation or test datasets.
    ## Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on unseen data.

# Examples
    ## linear regression
    ## logistic regression
    ## neural networks
    ## decision trees
    ## Support vector machines (SVM)

Model-based learning involves training a model to generalize from data and then using it for efficient predictions. 
It is widely used in supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
