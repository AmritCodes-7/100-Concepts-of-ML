Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data. 
Unlike supervised learning, there are no predefined output labels. 
Instead, the algorithm identifies hidden patterns, relationships, or groupings in the data based solely on the input features.

# Key Features of Unsupervised Learning:
    No Labeled Data: The data used for training has no associated outputs or labels.
    Goal: Discover the underlying structure of the data, such as clusters or associations, without prior knowledge.

# Types of Tasks:
    ## Clustering: Grouping similar data points into clusters.

    ## Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features while preserving important information.

    ## Anomaly Detection: Identifying data points that deviate from the norm.

# How It Works:
    The algorithm processes the input data without supervision.
    It finds patterns, structures, or relationships based on the inherent properties of the data.
    The output depends on the type of task (e.g., clusters, reduced dimensions).

# Common Algorithms in Unsupervised Learning:
    ## Clustering:
        ### K-Means Clustering: Groups data points into k clusters based on their similarity.
        ### Hierarchical Clustering: Creates a hierarchy of clusters, which can be visualized as a dendrogram.
        ### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Groups data points based on density, identifying outliers as noise.

    ## Dimensionality Reduction:
        ### Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces the number of features by projecting data onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving variance.
        ### t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Visualizes high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D while maintaining local relationships.
        ### Autoencoders: Neural networks used to encode data into a smaller representation.

    ## Anomaly Detection:
        ### Isolation Forests
        ### One-Class SVM
        ### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
