Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. 
In this approach, the model is trained using input-output pairs, where the input data (features) is associated with the correct output (labels). 
The goal is for the model to learn the relationship between the inputs and outputs so it can predict the correct output for new, unseen data.

# Key Features of Supervised Learning:
    Labeled Data: The dataset contains both inputs (features) and corresponding outputs (labels).
    Training and Testing: The model is trained on a portion of the data (training set) and evaluated on unseen data (testing set).
    Objective: Minimize the error between the predicted outputs and the actual labels.

# Two Main Types:
    Classification: Predicts discrete labels (e.g., spam or not spam, cat or dog).
    Regression: Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices, stock prices).

# How It Works:
    ## Training Phase:
        Provide the algorithm with labeled data (input-output pairs).   
        The algorithm learns the mapping between inputs and outputs by finding patterns in the data.

    ## Testing/Prediction Phase:
        The trained model is applied to new, unseen data to predict outputs.
