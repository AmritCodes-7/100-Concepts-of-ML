# Classification:
    Definition: Classification is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict discrete labels or categories for given input data.
    Output: A class label (e.g., "cat" or "dog," 0 or 1).

Examples:
    Email classification: Spam or not spam.
    Sentiment analysis: Positive, neutral, or negative.
    Image recognition: Identify whether an image is a car, bike, or truck.

Algorithms:
    Logistic Regression
    Decision Trees
    Random Forests
    Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    Neural Networks (for complex tasks)

Metrics to Evaluate:
    Accuracy
    Precision, Recall, F1-Score
    Confusion Matrix
    ROC-AUC score

Example:
    If you're predicting whether a patient has a disease (Yes/No), this is a classification problem.
