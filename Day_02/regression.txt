# Regression
    Definition: Regression is a type of supervised learning task where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value based on input data.
    Output: A real number (e.g., temperature, price, or height).
    
Examples:
    Predicting house prices based on features like location and size.
    Forecasting stock prices.
    Estimating customer lifetime value.

Algorithms:
    Linear Regression
    Polynomial Regression
    Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    Random Forest Regression
    Neural Networks (for complex tasks)

Metrics to Evaluate:
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

Example:
    If you're predicting the price of a house based on features like size and location, this is a regression problem.
